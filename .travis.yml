# Update Composer.
  - composer selfupdate
# Install this project into a directory called "ci".
  - composer create-project -n --no-dev --prefer-dist blackboard-open-source/moodle-plugin-ci ci ^2

# This lists steps that are run for installation and setup.
install:
# Run the default install.  The overview of what this does:
#    - Clone the Moodle project into a directory called moodle.
#    - Create Moodle config.php, database, data directories, etc.
#    - Copy your plugin into Moodle.
#    - If your plugin has Behat features, then Behat will be setup.
#    - If your plugin has unit tests, then PHPUnit will be setup.
  - moodle-plugin-ci install

# This lists steps that are run for the purposes of testing.  Any of
# these steps can be re-ordered or removed to your liking.  And of
# course, you can add any of your own custom steps.

# This step lints your PHP files to check for syntax errors.
  - moodle-plugin-ci phplint
# This step runs the PHP Copy/Paste Detector on your plugin. This helps to find
# code duplication.
  - moodle-plugin-ci phpcpd
# This step runs the PHP Mess Detector on your plugin. This helps to find potential
# problems with your code which can result in refactoring opportunities.
  - moodle-plugin-ci phpmd
# This step runs the Moodle Code Checker to make sure that your plugin conforms to the
# Moodle coding standards.  It is highly recommended that you keep this step.
  - moodle-plugin-ci codechecker
# This step runs some light validation on the plugin file structure and code.  Validation can be plugin specific.
  - moodle-plugin-ci validate
# This step validates your plugin's upgrade steps.
# disable because it fails
#  - moodle-plugin-ci savepoints
# This step runs Grunt tasks on the plugin.  By default, it tries to run
# tasks relevant to your plugin and Moodle version, but you can run
# specific tasks by passing them as options,
# EG: moodle-plugin-ci grunt -t task1 -t task2
# To fail on eslint warnings use --max-lint-warnings 0
# disable because it fails
#  - moodle-plugin-ci grunt
# This step runs the PHPUnit tests of your plugin.  If your plugin has PHPUnit tests,
# then it is highly recommended that you keep this step.
  - moodle-plugin-ci phpunit
# This step runs the Behat tests of your plugin.  If your plugin has Behat tests, then
